# Functional-Genomics-Assignment-1
This assignment focused on quality control and initial analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using Monocle3. The tasks involved inspecting the dataset, visualizing data, and interpreting biological effects of genetic perturbations. 

I calculated the number of cells and genes and analyzed dataset dimensions. The distribution of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and quantified genes was visualized using violin plots. Median values were overlaid to highlight central tendencies.

I generated summaries of genetic perturbations or treatments and created QC plots for each condition. Known biological pathways associated with perturbations were briefly summarized. Conceptual questions included discussing sequencing technologies for repetitive genome regions and analyzing GWAS results.
